# Laser Security Alarm System

This is my mini-project on a laser-based security alarm system.

## Project Overview
The system uses a laser beam and a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to detect intrusions. When the laser beam is interrupted, the LDR triggers a buzzer to alert about the intrusion.

## Components Used
- Laser Pointer
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- Buzzer
- LED
- Battery
- PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
- Resistor

## Working
The laser beam continuously falls on the LDR. When an object blocks the laser beam, the LDR detects the change and activates the buzzer, producing an alarm sound.

## Applications
- Home security
- Locker safety
- Office and garage security
- Monitoring pets and children

## Files Included
- Project PPT

## About
This project is simple, low-cost, and useful for basic security in small areas. It can be used both indoors and outdoors.
